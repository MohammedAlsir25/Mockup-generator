## ✨ Features

This application offers two powerful creative modes:

### 1. 🌐 URL Redesign Showcase
-   **Input**: Provide a website URL and a single screenshot of the site.
-   **Output**: The AI analyzes the site's purpose and branding to generate a **single showcase image** containing **four distinct, thematic redesigns**. Perfect for visualizing potential improvements and different aesthetic directions for an existing website.

### 2. 🖼️ Mockup from Screenshots
-   **Input**: Upload multiple screenshots of a website or application.
-   **Output**: The AI acts as a creative director, generating **five unique, professional promotional images**. Each image artfully arranges all your screenshots into a dynamic, marketable composition, similar to showcases seen on Dribbble or ThemeForest.

### Core Features
-   🧠 **AI-Powered Creativity**: Leverages the advanced image understanding and generation capabilities of the **Google Gemini API**.
-   🎨 **High-Quality Output**: Creates high-resolution, polished images ready for portfolios, presentations, or marketing materials.
-   🚀 **Modern & Responsive UI**: Built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS for a sleek, fast, and intuitive user experience.
-   👆 **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-use forms with drag-and-drop support for a seamless workflow.
-   ⬇️ **Easy Download**: Instantly download any or all of the generated mockups with a single click.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get this project running, you'll need to set up the code and provide your own Google Gemini API key.

### Prerequisites

-   A valid API key for the **Google Gemini API**. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/MohammedAlsir25/mockup-generator.git
    cd mockup-generator
  

2.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    The application requires your Google Gemini API key to be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`. The method for setting this depends on the environment where you are running the code.

    For local development, you could create a `.env` file in the root of the project and use a tool like `dotenv` to load it, or set it directly in your shell:
    ```
    # .env file
    API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    Open the `index.html` file in your browser. The application is self-contained and uses an `importmap` to load dependencies, so no local server or build step is strictly necessary for it to run.

    ## Run Locally

            `npm run dev`
    
      **Prerequisites:**  Node.js


      1. Install dependencies:
            `npm install`
      2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
